#Fitendo

Fitendo was a project for [Vegas Hackathon](https://twitter.com/vegashackathon) in 2013 by [@noopkat](http://twitter.com/noopkat) and [@makenai](http://twitter.com/makenai). It uses the [FitBit API](https://www.fitbit.com/dev/dev) to get your step data and rewards you by showing Mario progressing in a game of Super Mario Brothers!

You can try it out at [fitendo.net](http://fitendo.net)

This was written as a Rails app to handle all of the OAuth key exchange ith FitBit, but the majority of the fun was in JavaScript. The original idea was to use some sort of JavaScript based emulator, but it quickly got too complicated. We settled on using a YouTube video and did some really simplistic calculation to guess how many mario steps equalled a human step in slices of time. All of the goals are timestamp based.

BetaBrand was one of the sponsors, and we came in determined to win pants. We have to leave early because of another event, but left [Mark](https://twitter.com/markjohnsoncc), who also created the logo for us, to present. As it turned out, we won one of the fun taims categories and won two pairs of [very bright](http://www.betabrand.com/womens-red-pants-friday.html) [red pants](http://www.betabrand.com/mens-red-pants-friday.html).
